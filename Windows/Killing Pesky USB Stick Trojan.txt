Steps to remove shortcut virus:

1. Open the command prompt.
2. Assuming that your target drive letter is L, type the following
	C:\> cd /d L:
	L:\> attrib -s -h -a -r /s /d *.*
3. You should now see all the invisible files along with the shortcut. Delete them except the autorun.inf file.
4. Download Process Explorer by Sysinternals and Unlocker 1.9 by Collomb.
5. Use the Unlocker and determine the process that is using the autorun.inf sorry for the image, imgur.com kills the quality. In the image, wuauclt.exe is using the autorun.inf 
6. Open the Process Explorer and look for the process. Press CTRL+L and sort the ‘type’ column. Scrolldown to the ‘file’ type.
7. You should see the autorun.inf being used by the process. If you don’t see it, you are looking at thewrong process. Right click the row and select Close handle.
8. The autorun.inf should be removable already. Next we need to see if there is already a backdoor in ourcomputer. Look again at the ‘files’ being used by the process and search something suspicious. Typicallyfound in your C:\users\your-username-here. Look for something like this. AppData\Local\Temp\mstuaespm.pif
9. Close the handle, just like what you did in autorun.inf then remove the file inside your drive.
